[Basics]
Each comment has to fit into one line. But the character count does not matter.
You can assign your comments to sections, also it is easier to find them again in the editor. Sections begin with <code>[</code> and end with <code>]</code>.

Emty lines doesn't matter in the source file.
You can select multiple source files. Similar sections will be merged.
